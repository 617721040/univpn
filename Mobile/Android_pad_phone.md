# Configuration L2TP over IPSec VPN by Settings

```bash
in Android 12 both IPsec Xauth and L2TP were removed completly.
The only available authentication types of the android vpn built-in client are:
IKEv2/IPsec MSCHAPv2
IKEv2/IPSec PSK
IKEv2/IPSec RSA

so, if your device were Android version 12, don't add this VPN
```

```Network administrator will provide you with information```
